## Project Overview

The exercises in this repository cover a range of topics within data analytics, including data manipulation, statistical analysis, data visualization, and more. They are intended to provide hands-on experience with real-world datasets and scenarios, facilitating the development of practical skills in data analysis.

## Features

- **Diverse Topics**: Exercises encompass various aspects of data analytics, from basic data manipulation to advanced statistical modeling.
- **Real-World Datasets**: Engage with authentic datasets to simulate real-world data analysis challenges.
- **Incremental Complexity**: Exercises are structured to progressively increase in complexity, catering to both beginners and advanced learners.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Focused on practical applications rather than just theoretical concepts.
- **Code Examples**: Each exercise includes commented code to guide you through the solution process.

## Getting Started

To begin working with these exercises, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python package installer)
- (Optional) [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for creating isolated Python environments

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sroman0/Data-analytics.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Data-analytics
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Running the Exercises

To run the exercises:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open an Exercise**: In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the desired exercise notebook and open it.

3. **Execute the Notebook**: Follow the instructions within the notebook, executing each cell sequentially.

4. **Modify and Experiment**: Feel free to modify the code to better understand the concepts and experiment with different datasets.

## Project Structure
